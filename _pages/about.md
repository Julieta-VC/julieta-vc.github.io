I am a PhD candidate in the [Wilf Family Department of Politics](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/politics.html) at NYU, and a graduate affiliate of the [Identities & Ideologies Project](https://www.identities-ideologies.org/).

My research is on Comparative Politics and Political Behavior from the citizens' perspective. In particular, I study conflict and participation, with an emphasis on social movements, inequality, gender, identity, and violence. I use a multi-methods approach that favors causal inference and experiments.

In my dissertation, I explore how women react and organize to the threat of gender violence with a special (but non-exclusive) focus on Latin America. 

Before the PhD, I earned a B.S. in Economics from Universidad de Chile and an M.A. in Politics from NYU.
